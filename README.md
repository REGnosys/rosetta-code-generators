Did you want to leverage the power of the *Rosetta* DSL for your project but in a language other than the (Java) default implementation?

You can use this guide and write your own code generator in the language of your choosing.

### What is it

*Rosetta* is an open source DSL comprising of a grammar and a set of code generators. To learn more, visit [*Rosetta*](https://github.com/REGnosys/rosetta-dsl).

The DSL repository has 2 build in code generators:
 - [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/).  See code generator [here](https://github.com/REGnosys/rosetta-dsl/blob/master/com.regnosys.rosetta/src/com/regnosys/rosetta/generator/java/object/ModelObjectGenerator.xtend)
 - [DAML](https://daml.com/). See code generator [here](https://github.com/REGnosys/rosetta-dsl/blob/master/com.regnosys.rosetta/src/com/regnosys/rosetta/generator/daml/object/DamlModelObjectGenerator.xtend)

The DAML code generator will be moved to this repo in good time. 

This repository allows the *Rosetta* community to contribute code generators e.g. Go, Python etc. It works by allowing API hooks to get access to the [Ecore](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Ecore) model which represents the data elements in the *Rosetta* DSL, and allows you to perform a model transformation.

The API expects an input of a set *Rosetta* files (with extension .rosetta). We are putting together a comprehensive guide on how to write *Rosetta* files and will be available soon.

The *Rosetta* files are parsed and an Ecore model instance is produced. This Ecore Model is then accessible via an API hook in this repo.

### Writing a generator

To provide your own, simply create a new package under ``` src/main/java/com/regnosys/rosetta/generators/``` 
and subclass the ``` AbstractExternalGenerator```  class and provide a concrete implementation of its generate method.

```
public abstract Map<String, ? extends CharSequence> generate(RosettaJavaPackages packages, List<RosettaRootElement> elements, String version);
```

There is already an example that generates some sample source code (it is valid Groovy code):

```
src/main/java/com/regnosys/rosetta/generators/sample/SampleCodeGenerator.java
```

You can then test your code with a JUnit test, like

```
src/test/java/com/regnosys/rosetta/generators/sample/SampleCodeGeneratorTest.java
```

In package ```src/test/java/com/regnosys/rosetta/generators/framework``` there is some infrastructure code

that weaves together, using the Google Guice dependency injection mechanism, all the necessary elements to run a rosetta enabled app and then parses a sample rosetta file.

In folder ```src/test/resources/rosetta``` you can see two files:

```types.rosetta``` contains the basic types that a rosetta DSL can contain, like  ```string```, ```int```, ```time``` etc.

These types are used to bootstrap the rosetta enabled app.

```sample.rosetta``` contains a simple rosetta class with a few attributes of type ```string``` & ```int```

Finally, in  ```src/test/resources/sample/Foo.groovy.sample``` the file contains the correct source code, against which we will compare our results
